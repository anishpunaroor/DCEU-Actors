# The Movie Index

The Movie Index is a static website that I designed to become familiar with Javascript as well as front-end developemnt in general. This allows users to search for any movie, filter by genre, and sort by popularity. I have also incorporated pagination into the website so users can browse multiple pages of provided movies.

## Design

The Movie Index is built using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS, and I integrated Bootstrap to help with the navigation bar and button components. 

This website is powered by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org)'s free API. While it's great for movies, it unfortunately does not track all cast from TV episodes.

For an added challenge and simplicity, I did not use any other UI layout frameworks in The Movie Index.
