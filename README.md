# The Movie Index

The Movie Index is a static website that I designed to become familiar with Javascript as well as front-end development in general. This allows users to search for any movie, filter by genre, and sort by popularity. I have also incorporated pagination into the website so users can browse multiple pages of the provided results.

## Design

The Movie Index is built using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS, and I integrated Bootstrap to help with the navigation bar and button components. 

This website is powered by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org)'s free API. One issue I have noticed is that some of the movies retrieved using this API do not have corresponding posters or overviews, resulting in a blank image/description. 

For an added challenge and simplicity, I did not use any other UI layout frameworks in The Movie Index.

The website was deployed using AWS Amplify.
